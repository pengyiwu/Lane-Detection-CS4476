Qualitative Description Overview

1. Define a line class in order to draw line on image and use x,y coordinates to define a line

2. Get a test image directory

3. Specify a specific test image

4. Preprocess the image so that the image is in grayscale and the image is blurred with Gaussian blur.

5. Calculate Edges with Canny Edge Detector

6. Apply Hough Transform to Detect Lines

7. Filter two lines such that it matches what is expected for a lane line

8. Begin Drawing Lanes

9. Define Polygon Mask for Lane

10. Mask Lines to draw on the image

11. Evaluate the error
